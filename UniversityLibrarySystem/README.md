The University of London wants to create a new software for managing the University Library. You are asked to design the software for this application given the followng rudimentary specfications:

* The library has books, scientific journals and newspapers.
* Books and scientific journals are available in standard printed form but also online in a downloadable pdf format,  while newspapers are not digitized and are only available in the printed version.
* Main customers of the library are University enrolled students and Professors that can borrow books, journals and newspapers free of charge. The maximum allowed number of borrowed items for a specific customer is 3 and 10 for students and professor respectovely.
* Customers can choose the printed version or a temporary access to the online pdf version: if this secong option is selected there is no  limit in the number of accessible books or journals.
* The University Library is also open for external customers not directly connected to the University (not students neither professors), but for this category of customers, it is needed to pay an annual subscription fee to the library.
* The maximum time period for the borrowing is one month; after this period is passed, the system must be able to send automatic reminder to the customers and to alert a human operator in the case the customer is not returning the item for two months.
* The employees of the library can start a procedure for buying new books or to subscribe to new scintific journals or newspapers after a request from a professor that is also responsible for paying the item he wants to order.
* An online feedbach system is able to collect customer comments on a specfic book, journal or newspaper: this feesback system can be useful for new customer if they want to choose something to borrow from the library.
