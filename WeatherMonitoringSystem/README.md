A company wants to build a software for a weather monitoring system (wms). The system has sensors for measuring temperature, humidity , barometric pressure , wind speed and direction , etc. The system is able to display these readings in real time on a display but can also keep track of historical information on an hourly and daily basis. This historical data can be pulled up on the display at the request of the user.

The most common mode of the WMS is when it is displaying current weather monitoring data. Each of the values are updated at their own particular rate. Temperature is updated once per minute , while barometric pressure is updated once every five minutes . The WMS  must be able to report the trend of the barometric pressure . This is a value and can have three states: rising , falling or stable .

You are asked to design the described software , **focusing on use cases first** and then choosing **one significant use case** and expanding and analyzing it with all the elements you believe are useful for better understamding and modeling the problem . Try to write a first draft implementation of the most significant classes by using C# and test driven development.
